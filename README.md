# Bachelor-Thesis

In this thesis we study approximation algorithms for the problem of single-Â­source unsplittable flows. We explain why it was introduced as a problem by Kleinberg [7, 8], we refer to the relevant results from then on, and analyze the (by far) most recent relevant publication by Morell and Skutella [12]. Morell and Skutella [12] simplify the proof of the main theorem of a publication of Dinitz, Garg, and Goemans [4] significantly, and generalize this and older results.
